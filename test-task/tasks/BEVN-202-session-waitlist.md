# BEVN-202 — Session Waitlist

> Phase 2 — New Features · both tracks · SPEC-DRIVEN
> Rules: [ASSIGNMENT.md](../README.md) · Route: [PRODUCT.md](../PRODUCT.md)

When a session has reached its capacity, an attendee can join a waitlist. If a registered attendee cancels, the first person on the waitlist is automatically promoted to a confirmed registration. This promotion should be logged. The session detail page shows current registration count, capacity, and waitlist count.

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] `POST /api/sessions/{id}/waitlist` adds an attendee to the waitlist
- [ ] Registering for a session at capacity returns 409 — does not auto-waitlist
- [ ] Cancelling a confirmed registration triggers automatic promotion of the next waitlisted attendee
- [ ] Promotion is logged at INFO level with attendee ID and session ID
- [ ] `GET /api/sessions/{id}` response includes `registeredCount`, `capacity`, `waitlistCount`
- [ ] Session detail page shows capacity and waitlist count
- [ ] Unit tests cover: join waitlist, cancel triggers promotion, waitlist ordering
